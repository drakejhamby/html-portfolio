<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m originally from Tennessee, but I moved to Utah in pursuit of new opportunities and to challenge 
   myself in different ways. Right now, I’m working toward a career in full-stack web development, 
  which is a natural fit for my love of technology and how things work. I’m always eager to dive 
  into new tech, whether it’s learning the latest tools or exploring deeper concepts in coding.</p>

<p>Along the way, I’ve also become fluent in Spanish, and I’m continuing my language journey by learning
   Mandarin Chinese. I love expanding my horizons, whether it's through mastering new programming 
   languages or spoken ones. There's something incredibly rewarding about connecting with people and 
   ideas through language, and I’m always eager to push myself in that regard.</p>

<p>Outside of tech and learning, I’m passionate about video games and spending time outdoors. 
  Whether I’m immersed in a game or exploring the world around me, I love having diverse experiences 
  that keep life interesting. At the core, I’m driven by curiosity and a love for learning, which keeps
   me excited about both my career and the world in general.</p>
