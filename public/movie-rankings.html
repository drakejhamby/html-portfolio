<h1>The Best Movies According to Drake</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>Fantastic music and cast. The action is fast-paced and the humor is witty.</p>

<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>I'm not usually a fan of musicals, but this one is a must see. The way it perfectly blends a melody of contempary songs (for the time), and Ewan McGregor's performace really make it a masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Star Wars: A New Hope</h3>
<p>This is the essential starting point for modern sci-fi cinema.</p>
